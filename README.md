# APTScholar

**APTScholar** is a decentralized platform designed for transparent and automated scholarship distribution, leveraging the security and reliability of the Aptos blockchain. By eliminating intermediaries and embedding eligibility and disbursement logic directly into smart contracts, APTScholar offers an efficient, trustless, and verifiable system for managing scholarships at scale.

---

## Overview

APTScholar introduces a fully decentralized infrastructure for scholarship application, verification, and fund disbursement. Built using Move smart contracts on the Aptos blockchain, the platform ensures that each transaction—from application submission to final payment—is permanently recorded, auditable, and resistant to tampering.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Application Workflow**  
  All application data is processed and validated through on-chain logic.

- **Automated Disbursement**  
  Funds are distributed automatically via smart contracts once eligibility conditions are met.

- **Transparent and Verifiable Records**  
  Every transaction is publicly accessible and cryptographically secured on the Aptos blockchain.

- **AI-Powered Assistance**  
  An integrated chatbot provides support throughout the application process, offering guidance, answering questions, and improving user experience.

- **Secure File Management**  
  Applicant documents are handled through decentralized storage, ensuring data integrity and availability.

## Architecture

### Blockchain Layer: Aptos

APTScholar utilizes the Aptos blockchain for the core logic and data integrity of the platform. Aptos offers a scalable, low-latency infrastructure suitable for smart contract-based systems.

- **Smart Contracts**  
  Written in Move, smart contracts enforce the rules for application handling, eligibility verification, and fund transfers.

- **Deployed Contract**  
  - **Address:** `0x47f9407af53e1e236bc95b74c34509e169ddb5309bed8202c07b294a36803d1f`  
  - **Explorer:** [Aptos Testnet - View Contract](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/txn/6807947204?network=testnet)

### Frontend: React.js

The web interface is developed using React.js, providing:

- A responsive application portal for students
- Administrative tools for reviewing and managing applications
- Blockchain transaction feedback and interaction

### Backend: Node.js

Node.js services act as an intermediary for:

- Managing decentralized file access
- Preparing data for smart contract transactions
- Serving API endpoints for frontend interaction

### Chatbot: Langchain + Mistral

The platform includes a conversational assistant integrated with Langchain and powered by Mistral models. The chatbot assists users by:

- Explaining the application process
- Checking eligibility conditions
- Providing real-time feedback and suggestions
